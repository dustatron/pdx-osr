        At pdx osr, we are a passionate community dedicated to preserving and
        celebrating the rich traditions of Old School Revival (OSR) tabletop
        role-playing games. Rooted in the philosophies of Matt Finch's Four
        Pillars of OSR, we emphasize:

        We believe that OSR games are defined by their open-ended nature,
        allowing for a diverse range of genres and settings. Whether it's a
        traditional dungeon crawl, a DCC wrestling campaign, or a unique setting
        like Cairn or Ziggurat of Doom, all are welcome. Our community thrives
        on inclusivity, drawing inspiration from small creators and
        anti-corporate sentiments, and we encourage historical themes and
        settings.
