# Oregon Sorcerous Realm

Join Oregon Sorcerous Realms (OrSoRe, rhymes with sorcery) and open the door to endless, exciting live tabletop roleplaying adventures!

Our focus is providing access to "classic games" at open-play tables stretching throughout the greater Willamette Valley area. We focus on systems that recreate the spirit of classic RPGs from the 70s & 80s, including Dungeons & Dragons (D&D), Shadowdark, Old School Essentials (OSE), Dungeon Crawl classics (DCC), Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay (WHFRP), and many more!
