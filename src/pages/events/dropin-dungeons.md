Drop-In Dungeons is offering **DAY CAMPS** for 10-15 year olds this summer with an RPG Adventure Camp, Dungeon Mastery Camp, and a Magic: the Gathering Camp. The schedule for the monthly, commitment-free roleplaying adventures in Portland, Oregon include:

- As available: **Wildcard Night** with a variety of games at venues around Portland.
- **Weekly: Star Trek Adventures Campaign** at Battle Grounds Gaming Cafe. The [quickstart guide](https://modiphius.net/en-us/products/star-trek-adventures-the-roleplaying-game-second-edition-quickstart-guide-pdf) is available online.
- **1st Tuesday and 3rd Tuesday: Shadowdark Megadungeon Night** at TPK Brewing Co.
- **2nd Monday: Game Masters' Coffee Conclave** at Battle Grounds Gaming Cafe
- **2nd Wednesday and 4th Monday: OSR Megadungeon Night** at Experiment PDX and Birdie Time Pub respectively.
- **3rd Wednesday: Shadowdark Hexcrawl Night** at Experiment PDX.
- **4th Wednesday: Broad Horizons Night** at Battle Grounds Gaming Cafe, with multiple non-D&D-based options.

The Dungeon has player expectations which include respecting the venue and its staff, non-participating people nearby, the gaming premise, and other players. The [Golden Rule](https://www.battlegroundsgamingcafe.com/summer-camps) is preferring the fun of everyone at the table over a character's action.
