PDX OSR CON 1 is July 26th at Black Water Bar on NE Sandy in collab w/ our friends at Dark Future Dungeon.

We have 18 awesome looking games with a variety of OSR and NSR titles lined up running in two phases, 12-4 and 5-9. This should be a lot of fun.

OSE, AD&D, Earthdawn, MERP, Paranoia, Bugbears and Borderlands, Liminal Horror, Cheap Heat, MORK BORG, Pirate Borg, Shadowdark, Shadowfinder, Shadowrun, DCC - it's madness, and there are some very cool GMs who have rallied to run some crazy games for you!

Registration
Registration is free, but limited due to space. The games are listed on our Heylo page (like Meetup, but free) - currently registration is CLOSED, but all games will OPEN for registration this Sunday (6/29) at 5 PM, mark your calendar, create a reminder, etc, etc, etc. Even with 18 games we anticipate this will fill up fairly quickly!!
Here is the Heylo page, you will need to sign-up to be able to register --> I would get that done ahead of time so that you don't have any annoyance possibly having to create an account while others are scrambling to fill seats up! You have been forewarned!

### _Disclaimer_
**PDX OSR** is inclusive - We expect all participants to behave with common courtesy and respect towards other individuals as well as the establishments generously allowing us space to run games.

Harassment with regard to gender, sexual orientation, dress, age, race, religion or lack thereof, political affiliation, disability, or involvement or noninvolvement in any group is not allowed.

Fantasy violence is commonplace in RPGs (something to consider...) - that said, adult-themed games are for adults, and GMs must clearly disclose all such content in the game’s event description—no surprises on potentially offensive material. To be clear, graphic sexual content is never acceptable. Please use common sense.
